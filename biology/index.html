              <h2>Biology 1010</h2>
              <p>Biology 1010 has been a great opportunity for me to build on concepts, that I had already been taught, and then delve into them on a deeper level. It was very rewarding to feel like my understanding of the world around me was being pushed and broadened. I came to appreciate the complexity with which we are capable of looking at and understanding the world, as well as how intricately things tie together.</p>
              <p>I really enjoyed learning about how incredible our bodies are, and how the seemingly simplest of things can play a major roll in our well being. An example of this for me are two friends whom currently have cancer. I found it interesting to learn that there are drugs capable of preventing substrate from binding to the active site of an enzyme, that could cause cancer. In particular, I liked learning about non-competitive inhibition, and how a drug can be used to bind outside of the active site of an enzyme. By doing this, they prevent the substrate from being able to bind to the active site, because it has changed the shape of the structure. But that small thing can have a great impact on the health of my friends.</p>
              <p>Additionally, I liked the opportunity to learn about evolution. My lab teacher gave advice to the class that if we went about limiting evolution to whether or not man really evolved from chimpanzees, we would be missing out on some really amazing things going on in the world around us. I found this to be good advice. I liked learning about the ways our bodies, and the bodies of other creatures, have changed over the years. Many people know that humans no longer need their appendix, or have much use for tailbones. But looking at a whale and wondering why it has a pelvis, was a new perspective for me. </p>
